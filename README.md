=======================

A possible implementation of Infinite scroll datatable
------------------------------------------------------

The intend of this project is show a possible implementation infinite scroll datatable using [facebook's fixed-datatable](https://facebook.github.io/fixed-data-table)

The idea is to show howto implement an ISDT using fixed-datatable, It could be not the best way, or maybe the only way to do it, we can start to discuss and modifying this code ultil to get the final/best implementation, since I couldn't found on nowhere this, I decided start it!

Best Regards.
